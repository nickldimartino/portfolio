export const HERO_CONTENT = `As a Solutions Engineer at SmartBear, I’m leveraging my foundation in software development and embedded systems to craft impactful demos, solve real-world challenges, and support successful Proof of Concepts. I’ve found a fulfilling home here—working alongside a passionate team and helping customers translate complex technical needs into powerful solutions.

My journey has been anything but linear—from web development at General Assembly to two years in embedded software, all built on the discipline and teamwork instilled by my military service. That experience, combined with a detail-driven mindset shaped by the military, academia, bodybuilding, and defense, has made me a resilient and growth-oriented engineer.

I'm proud of where I am and excited for what lies ahead—continuing to grow, contribute, and thrive at the intersection of technology, collaboration, and innovation.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I'm a Solutions Engineer at SmartBear with a strong foundation in software engineering, shaped by hands-on experience in embedded systems at General Dynamics, full stack web development through General Assembly, and technical mentorship in the U.S. Air Force. My transition into pre-sales engineering was driven by a passion for solving real-world customer problems through impactful demos, proof-of-concepts, and technical storytelling.

At SmartBear, I collaborate with sales and product teams to showcase the power of our API testing suite—ReadyAPI, API Hub, TestHub, and more—crafting tailored technical demonstrations that resonate with diverse stakeholders. I specialize in translating complex functionality into clear business value, and I thrive in environments where curiosity, precision, and cross-functional collaboration are key to success.

My military background instilled a mindset of discipline, structure, and resilience—qualities that now guide my approach to customer engagement, demo creation, and solution development. Whether leading POCs, responding to RFPs, or aligning technical solutions with strategic business goals, I bring a sharp attention to detail, a methodical approach, and a sincere desire to help others succeed.

I'm always open to sharing what I’ve learned about the tech industry, software career growth, and effective communication in engineering. Let's connect if you want to talk APIs, demos, or breaking into tech with confidence.
