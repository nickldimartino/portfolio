Solutions Engineer and military veteran with a strong foundation in software development and SaaS platforms. Experienced leading technical
discovery, delivering tailored demos and Proofs of Concept (POCs), and supporting complex customer evaluations in partnership with Sales,
Product, Marketing, and Engineering. Skilled at translating complex systems, integrations, and workflows into clear, outcome-driven narratives
that accelerate adoption and technical decision-making. `;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `
Solutions Engineer at SmartBear with a strong foundation in software engineering and a focus on pre-sales and customer-facing technical work. My background spans embedded systems at General Dynamics, full-stack web development through General Assembly, and technical mentorship in the U.S. Air Force.

I transitioned into Solutions Engineering to focus on what I enjoy most: solving real customer problems through tailored demos, proof-of-concepts, and clear, narrative-driven technical explanations. At SmartBear, I partner closely with Sales and Product teams to support customer evaluations across the pre- and post-sales lifecycle, from discovery and demos through implementation, validation, and ongoing technical alignment.

My work centers on showcasing the value of API testing and quality tooling by crafting demos aligned to the priorities of engineers, QA teams, and business decision-makers. I specialize in translating complex systems, integrations, and workflows into clear outcomes that help customers make confident technical decisions.

My military background instilled discipline, structure, and attention to detail which are traits that shape my approach to customer engagement, demo design, and solution development. Whether leading POCs, supporting RFPs, or aligning solutions to business goals, I bring a methodical, preparation-driven mindset to every engagement.

I’m currently pursuing an M.S. in Engineering Management to strengthen my ability to lead technical initiatives and support data-driven decision-making in complex organizations.

I enjoy sharing what I’ve learned about software, Solutions Engineering, and effective technical communication. Let’s connect if you want to talk APIs, demos, or building strong technical careers.`;
